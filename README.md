# WordCloud Project

Wordclouds are a fun and visually appealing way of viewing frequently used words in a dataset. An example of when one of these could be useful in a business setting is identifying common themes in customer feedback surveys.

As a big fan of Nirvana, I decided it could be fun to see some of the most common words used in thier lyrics.

## Utilizing Python, I was able to identify common themes and topics in their lyrics:

## Then I broke it down by lyrics from songs released in the 80s:
